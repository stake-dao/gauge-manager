# Gauge Manager

## Overview

Gauge Manager is a contract that allows to deploy liquidity gauges on multiple networks, be the common reward distributor for all of them, with permissionless access, and allows the deployer to manage them, by adding extra rewards.

Regular admin functions are restricted to the on-chain governance of the platform built-upon, here Curve.fi.

It is built to overcome the limitation where only one eligible address can provide extra rewards to a gauge, by being the reward distributor.
